# OpenBrain guardrail: the vault never pushes to a protected remote.
#
# Every ref in a vault repo carries personal history, so pushes to public
# template/starter repos are blocked wholesale — no ref parsing, no topic-
# branch exceptions. Legitimate template contributions go through
# /push-openbrain-template, which genericizes and pushes from a
# separate template clone, never from the vault.
#
# Protected URL patterns come from .openbrain/protected-remotes (one shell
# glob per line; blank lines and # comments ignored). If that file does not
# exist, the default pattern below applies. If your own private vault remote
# legitimately matches the default (e.g. a private fork whose URL contains
# "openbrain-claude-starter"), create protected-remotes with the patterns
# that fit your setup. Deliberate one-off override: git push --no-verify.
#
# Linked into .git/hooks/pre-push by setup.sh and re-linked (self-healing)
# by on-start.sh.

# Hooks run from the top of the working tree, but resolve it explicitly —
# BASH_SOURCE points into .git/hooks/ when invoked via the symlink.
