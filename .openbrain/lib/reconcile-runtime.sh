# reconcile-runtime.sh — make the per-machine RUNTIME match the vault's tracked
# source, so "pulled == live". The deploy step the pull (and on-start) invoke.
#
# Deterministic + idempotent: same inputs → same result, re-runnable after any
# crash. Keys on RUNTIME-vs-SOURCE drift, NOT on any pull delta or marker — so
# it catches drift from ANY cause (incl. a launcher that drifted from a pull
# that predates this feature), at any time, even at the same build.
#
# SECRET-BLIND: drift DETECTION reads only tracked files + settings.json
# structure — never .env. The single step that needs secrets (the ~/.claude.json
# registry rewrite) is delegated wholesale to register-mcps.sh (already trusted)
# and only runs on --apply. This keeps the pull's read-only/safe-anytime contract
# intact everywhere except that one audited subprocess.
#
# Loci (what a PULL can change):
#   - MCP launchers: $VAULT/.openbrain/lib/{*-mcp.sh,_common.sh} → $LIB_DIR,
#     plus orphan *-mcp.sh in $LIB_DIR. Scoped to exactly that set — shims/,
#     clone-tier scripts, and .orphaned-launchers/ are never considered.
#   - Claude hook wiring: openbrain entries in .claude/settings.json.
# Account-config drift (accounts added/removed) is NOT handled here — that goes
# through add-account → register-mcps directly. This is tracked-file → runtime.
#
# Modes:
#   --check (default): report drift; exit 0 = in sync, 10 = drift present.
#   --apply          : converge, then report whether a Claude restart is needed.
#
# Test seam (NEVER point at live config in a test): OPENBRAIN_LIB_DIR,
# OPENBRAIN_CLAUDE_JSON, OPENBRAIN_ENV_FILE, OPENBRAIN_SETTINGS_FILE.

# "pulled == live" covers the script path, entry presence, and dedup, NOT
