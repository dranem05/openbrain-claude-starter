# refresh-google-tokens.sh — refresh OAuth tokens for configured Google accounts.
#
# Three modes:
#
#   refresh-google-tokens.sh              # probe + refresh access tokens for every
#                                         # configured account (non-interactive).
#                                         # Reports OK or NEEDS-REAUTH per slug.
#                                         # Use when MCPs start failing — finds
#                                         # which account's refresh_token is dead.
#
#   refresh-google-tokens.sh <email>      # full re-auth (OAuth flow in browser)
#                                         # for one account. Delegates to
#                                         # add-google-account.sh. Use when probe
#                                         # reports NEEDS-REAUTH, or after scope
#                                         # changes / revoke / reset.
#
#   refresh-google-tokens.sh --all        # full re-auth for every configured
#                                         # account. Opens N browsers in sequence.
#
# Background:
#   Each Google account's credentials live in $TOKEN_DIR/google-<slug>-credentials.json
#   plus 3 reshaped copies for the per-service MCPs (Calendar / Meet / Drive).
#   In probe mode this script exchanges the stored refresh_token for a fresh
#   access_token via Google's OAuth2 token endpoint and rewrites all 4 files.
#   The MCPs would normally do this on demand, but doing it explicitly:
#     1. detects revoked / expired refresh tokens before runtime,
#     2. warms the cached access_token so the next MCP call is fast.
