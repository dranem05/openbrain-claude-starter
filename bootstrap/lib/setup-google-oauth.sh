Follow these steps in your browser. Keep this terminal open; you'll paste
two values back at the end.

  1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com
  2. Create a new project (e.g. "openbrain-mcp") — or pick an existing one
  3. APIs & Services → Library → enable ALL of:
       • Gmail API
       • Google Calendar API
       • Google Meet REST API
       • Google Drive API
       • Google Docs API
       • Google Sheets API
  4. APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen
       • User Type: External
       • App name: OpenBrain MCP
       • Support email: (your email)
       • Developer contact: (your email)
       • Scopes: leave default (will be requested at runtime)
       • Publishing status:
           - Testing  → quickest path; add EVERY Google address you plan to wire
             up under "Test users". BUT Google expires refresh tokens after
             ~7 days in testing mode, so you'll re-auth every week.
           - In production (verified branding)  → long-lived refresh tokens
             (no 7-day expiry). Requires app verification — fine for a personal
             Desktop client with no public users; takes a few days but is a
             one-time cost. Recommended once you're past the experimentation phase.
  5. APIs & Services → Credentials → + Create credentials → OAuth client ID
       • Application type: Desktop app
       • Name: openbrain-mcp-desktop
       • Click Create
  6. A modal appears with the client ID and secret — copy both NOW. Google
     no longer lets you re-view the secret later; if you lose it you'll need
     to mint a new one via "+ Add secret".
