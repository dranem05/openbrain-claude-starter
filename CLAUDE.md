# CLAUDE.md — OpenBrain Vault Operating Manual

This vault is **{{USER_NAME}}'s OpenBrain**: a personal LYT (Linking Your Thinking) knowledge base where Claude Code is a first-class collaborator. Read this file at the start of every session in this vault.

> This file was generated from the [openbrain-claude-starter](https://github.com/davidianstyle/openbrain-claude-starter) template. Re-run `bootstrap/setup.sh` to regenerate account tables after adding/removing services, or run `bootstrap/lib/add-*.sh` for incremental changes.

## 1. Identity and structure

- **Primary collaborator:** {{USER_NAME}}.
- **Structure:** LYT / Maps of Content. Organization emerges from `[[wikilinks]]` and MOCs, not from deep folders.
- **Top-level folders** (the `+` prefix sorts them to the top of Obsidian's file explorer):
  - `+ Inbox/` — capture first, unprocessed notes land here
  - `+ Spaces/` — MOCs (Maps of Content) — curated link hubs per topic
  - `+ Atlas/` — atomic notes (the actual knowledge); `+ Atlas/Daily/` for daily notes, `+ Atlas/Weekly Reviews/` for weekly reviews
  - `+ Sources/` — literature and reference notes
  - `+ Extras/Templates/` — note templates (wired into Obsidian core Templates plugin)
  - `+ Extras/Attachments/` — legacy media folder (unused; Local Images Plus saves to `.resources/${notename}/` next to each note)
  - `+ Archive/` — cold storage
- **Home.md** is the front door; its "Top MOCs" section lists your Maps of Content.

## 2. Frontmatter schema (per template)

All notes must have frontmatter. Required fields by template:

- **Daily** — `title`, `date`, `tags: [daily]`
- **Literature** — `title`, `source`, `author`, `url`, `accessed`, `tags: [literature]`
- **MOC** — `title`, `tags: [moc]`, `created`
- **Atomic** — `title`, `created`, `tags`
- **Project** — `title`, `status`, `workspace` (personal|work), `asana_project_gid`, `created`, `tags: [project, moc]`
- **Task** — `title`, `asana_gid`, `asana_workspace`, `status`, `tags: [task]`
- **Person** — `title`, `relationship`, `cadence`, `created`, `tags: [person]` (plus optional `emails`, `slack`, `phones`, `aliases`, `last_contact`)
- **Interaction** — `title`, `date`, `channel`, `people`, `tags: [interaction]` (plus optional `projects`, `source`)
- **Idea** — `title`, `created`, `tags: [idea]`
- **Decision** — `title`, `date`, `status` (active|superseded|reversed), `tags: [decision]`
- **Goal** — `title`, `status` (active|paused|achieved|abandoned), `target_date`, `created`, `tags: [goal]`
- **Place** — `title`, `type` (church|office|restaurant|venue|home|other), `created`, `tags: [place]` (plus optional `address`)
- **Organization** — `title`, `type` (company|church|nonprofit|group|other), `created`, `tags: [organization]` (plus optional `url`)
- **Quote** — `title`, `author`, `source`, `created`, `tags: [quote]`

Missing-field notes are flagged (warn-only) by the pre-commit hook.

## 3. Link and tag conventions

- **Always prefer `[[wikilinks]]`** over markdown links for inter-vault references. Unlinked mentions of an existing note title should be upgraded to a link on next touch.
- **Tag taxonomy** (flat + hierarchical):
  - Content type: `#daily`, `#moc`, `#literature`, `#task`, `#project`, `#idea`, `#decision`, `#goal`, `#place`, `#organization`, `#quote`
  - Asana routing: `#asana/personal`, `#asana/work`
  - Project scoping: `#project/<slug>`
  - State: `#needs-review`, `#stub`
- No free-form tagging — if you want a new tag, propose it first.

## 4. Inbox triage workflow

When asked to triage `+ Inbox/`, or during scheduled nightly triage:

1. Read each note in `+ Inbox/`.
2. Classify: **atomic** (single idea → `+ Atlas/`), **literature** (external source → `+ Sources/`), **task** (actionable → see §5), **project kickoff** (multi-step → new MOC in `+ Spaces/`), or **ephemeral** (discard / archive).
3. Propose destination + any `[[links]]` to existing notes or MOCs.
4. **For scheduled/nightly runs:** act without confirmation when the classification is unambiguous AND notes with `#asana/*` tags get auto-pushed (see §5). Leave ambiguous items in `+ Inbox/` prepended with a `#needs-review` marker.
5. **For interactive runs:** propose and wait for approval before moving files.
6. When moving a note, update any existing backlinks.

## 5. Asana routing rules

Asana MCP servers are registered per workspace. The bootstrap supports any combination of `personal` and `work` (or skip entirely).

{{ASANA_ROUTING_TABLE}}

### Sync semantics

- Frontmatter fields `asana_gid` and `asana_workspace` are the source of truth for sync.
- **If `asana_gid` is set:** update the existing task. Never create a duplicate.
- **If `asana_gid` is empty:** create a new task and write the returned gid + workspace back into frontmatter.
- **Auto-push during nightly triage** is opt-in: if you've set that preference, notes tagged `#asana/*` push without confirmation in scheduled runs.
- Still confirm before creating Asana tasks for notes without clear tags, or for bulk operations (>5 tasks at once).

## 6. Writing assistant guidance

This section is the source of truth for how drafted communications should sound. The drafter skills (`/follow-up-draft`, `/daily-brief`, `/process-inbox`) read this section and apply it. To (re)derive these bullets from your real sent messages, run `/learn-writing-style`.

- **Drafting voice (general):** match {{USER_NAME}}'s voice — {{USER_VOICE}}. Default until you run `/learn-writing-style`: direct and terse, no filler, no preamble; lead with the ask or the answer.
- **Em-dashes:** use sparingly in drafted communications. LLM-generated messages tend to overuse them. `/learn-writing-style` will detect whether your sent messages avoid em-dashes entirely and, if so, replace this with a hard "never use" rule.
- **Email style:** complete sentences with proper capitalization. Sign off with your preferred closer (e.g. `Best, <your-first-name>`). Each paragraph is a single unbroken line; only use blank lines (`\n\n`) between paragraphs. Gmail preserves hard line breaks within a paragraph and renders them as a narrow column instead of reflowing, so never insert `\n` mid-paragraph.
- **Slack style — small audiences (DMs, group DMs, thread replies):** match the thread's existing tone, leaning casual. Skip greetings and sign-offs; just the substance. Use markdown (`*bold*`, backtick code, bullets) where it adds clarity.
- **Slack style — large audiences (broadcast channels, announcements):** more formal register. Bullets and bold for structure on longer posts. Lead with a one-line summary. Still no greetings/sign-offs.
- **Expanding stubs:** if a note is a one-liner or has `#stub`, offer to expand it using linked context and related notes.
- **Surfacing related notes:** use Grep / wikilink search across `+ Atlas/` and `+ Spaces/` to find genuinely relevant prior thinking before writing anything new.
- **Never invent facts** or create fake citations. If you need a source, say so.

_Default profile shipped with the starter. Run `/learn-writing-style` to derive these bullets from your real sent mail and Slack messages._

## 7. Research mode

- WebFetch → create a literature note in `+ Sources/` using the Literature template.
- Always include `url`, `author`, `accessed` date in frontmatter.
- Quote sparingly; summarize in your own words.
- Link from the literature note back to any Atlas notes or MOCs it relates to.

## 8. Obsidian interaction model

### Attachments

- **Local Images Plus** (recommended community plugin) auto-downloads and localizes external image URLs. Configure it with `realTimeUpdate: true` (5 s poll) and `processCreated: true` so it handles notes Claude creates. Be aware that image URLs Claude writes may be rewritten to local paths seconds later; do not treat the rewrite as an error or conflict.
- Attachments land in `.resources/${notename}/` next to the note (recommended plugin config).
- **Images/media:** save or reference in-line; the plugin handles localization.
- **External docs** (Google Docs, Sheets, PDFs hosted elsewhere): link by URL, don't download.
- **Meeting artifacts:** if a transcript references a shared screen or document, note it as `> [Shared: <description>]` in the interaction note body.

### Concurrent editing

Obsidian hot-reloads files when they change on disk. This is fine for content, but **frontmatter edits can race** — if you have a note open in Obsidian's Properties panel with unsaved changes, Claude's write may be overwritten when Obsidian saves. Convention:
- Do not edit a note's Properties panel in Obsidian while a skill that touches that note is running.
- For automated / scheduled runs this is a non-issue (you won't be editing simultaneously).
- Git is the sole sync mechanism (Obsidian Sync is disabled). The user handles git commits and pushes manually or via their own automation.

### Template evolution

When a template in `+ Extras/Templates/` gains or removes a required frontmatter field, existing notes won't match. The pre-commit hook lints for missing fields (warn-only), but hundreds of stale daily notes triggering warnings is noise, not signal. Convention:
- **Every template schema change must include a migration plan** — either a one-off Claude Code task to backfill/remove the field across existing notes, or an explicit decision to grandfather old notes.
- Document the change in the commit message so future sessions can reconstruct history.

## 9. What you must NOT do

- **Never silently delete notes.** Move to `+ Archive/` instead, and only on explicit request.
- **Never move notes out of `+ Archive/`** without explicit request.
- **Never push to Asana without a `#asana/*` tag.**
- **Never `git commit` or `git push` unless the user explicitly asks.** Git operations are the user's responsibility.
- **Never modify `~/.config/openbrain/.env`** or echo its contents.
- **Never use deprecated remote connectors** — `mcp__claude_ai_Asana__*`, `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Calendar__*`, `mcp__gmail__*`, `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__*` are single-account and bypass the multi-account routing defined in §11. Use the local `asana_*` / `google_*` / `slack_*` MCPs instead.
  - **Exception:** `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_send_message_draft` may be used for saving Slack drafts, since the local `slack_*` MCPs do not support draft creation. This is the only approved use of the deprecated connector. Never use it for sending messages or any other operation.
- **Never commit real secrets** to `.openbrain/env.example`. It is the tracked template; the real `.env` lives at `~/.config/openbrain/.env` (mode 600) and is out of repo.

## 10. Maintenance automation

- **Pre-commit hook** (`.openbrain/pre-commit.sh`) — frontmatter + broken-link linter, warn-only. Linked by setup.sh into `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
- **Auto git sync hooks** (opt-in, configured during setup):
  - **SessionStart hook** (`.openbrain/on-start.sh`) — `git pull --rebase` (fail-soft; never blocks).
  - **Stop hook** (`.openbrain/on-stop.sh`) — regenerates Home.md MOC index, then smart-commits all changes and pushes (skip-if-clean, pull-rebase first, conflict → inbox note).
  - These hooks are **not enabled by default**. Enable them during `./bootstrap/setup.sh` or by adding the hooks section to `.claude/settings.json` manually.

### Vault scaling and archive policy

Daily notes, interactions, and people candidates grow linearly. To keep the vault efficient for both Claude (grep/read) and Obsidian (graph, search):

- **Daily notes older than 6 months:** archive to `+ Archive/Daily/` during `/weekly-review`. The weekly review summary in `+ Atlas/Weekly Reviews/` is the long-term record; individual dailies are ephemeral once reviewed.
- **Interaction notes:** keep indefinitely in `+ Atlas/Interactions/` — they are the audit trail for the people model.
- **People candidates:** stubs in `+ Inbox/people-candidates/` older than 90 days without promotion should be archived to `+ Archive/People candidates/` during `/people-audit`.
- **Sources:** keep indefinitely — they are reference material.
- Archiving means `git mv` to the `+ Archive/` subtree. Backlinks from non-archived notes should be updated to point to the new path (Obsidian's auto-update handles this if the move happens in Obsidian; for Claude moves, update manually).

## 11. Multi-account MCP routing

Local stdio MCP servers, each scoped to a single account + service, launched via wrapper scripts in `~/.config/openbrain/` that source `.env`. All secrets live in `~/.config/openbrain/.env`; the tracked template is `.openbrain/env.example`.

Google services (Gmail, Calendar, Meet, Drive/Docs/Sheets, and Slides) are served by a single consolidated MCP server per account (`google-mcp`), launched via `google-mcp.sh <slug>`. Each server exposes tools prefixed by service: `gmail_*`, `calendar_*`, `meet_*`, `drive_*`, `docs_*`, `sheets_*`, `slides_*`.

### Configured accounts

{{GOOGLE_ACCOUNTS_TABLE}}

{{SLACK_WORKSPACES_TABLE}}

{{FATHOM_TABLE}}

### Slug convention

- **CLI slug:** `<local>-<domain-with-dashes>` for email accounts (e.g. `jane@acme.com` → `jane-acme-com`), `<subdomain>-slack-com` for Slack workspaces. Dashes only, no dots (Obsidian tag constraint).
- **MCP server key:** same slug with `-` → `_` (JSON key convention).
- **Env var name:** uppercased slug with `-` → `_`.

### Routing tags

- `#google/<slug>` — one per Google account (covers Gmail, Calendar, Meet, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides)
- `#slack/<slug>` — one per Slack workspace
- `#asana/personal`, `#asana/work` — Asana workspace routing
- `#workspace/personal` vs `#workspace/work` — umbrella grouping for cross-service filtering

### Adding an account after initial setup

Re-run the incremental add script from the vault root:

```bash
./bootstrap/lib/add-google-account.sh <email>      # adds one Google account (Gmail+Cal+Meet+Drive)
./bootstrap/lib/add-slack-workspace.sh <subdomain> # adds one Slack workspace
./bootstrap/lib/add-asana.sh personal|work         # adds Asana PAT + registers MCP
./bootstrap/lib/add-fathom.sh                      # adds Fathom API key + registers MCP
```

Each script is idempotent — safe to re-run.

## 12. People data model

- **MOC:** `+ Spaces/People.md` — curated grouping by relationship context.
- **Atomic notes:** `+ Atlas/People/<Full Name>.md` — one per person, created from `+ Extras/Templates/Person.md`. The Obsidian graph view is the authoritative relationship map.
- **Interactions:** `+ Atlas/Interactions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` — one atomic note per meeting, call, significant thread, or touchpoint, from `+ Extras/Templates/Interaction.md`. Linked back to people + projects via `[[wikilinks]]` in frontmatter arrays.

### Cadence semantics

Each person note has a `cadence:` field governing how often you should touch base:
- `weekly` — overdue at 8 days since `last_contact`
- `monthly` — overdue at 32 days
- `quarterly` — overdue at 95 days
- `asneeded` — never overdue

Overdue relationships surface in `/what-am-i-missing` and `/people-audit`.

### Candidate staging

New person notes discovered from automated sweeps (`/sync-people`, `/process-inbox` scheduled mode, `/capture-meeting` for unmatched participants) stage at `+ Inbox/people-candidates/<Full Name>.md` — **never directly in `+ Atlas/People/`**. Stubs carry `tags: [person, needs-review, stub]` and an `## Evidence` section listing source touchpoints. Promotion to `+ Atlas/People/` is a manual step: review, fill `relationship`, trim evidence, move file, drop `needs-review`/`stub` tags, and add to `+ Spaces/People.md`.

### Alias resolution

When matching a name or address to an existing person note:

1. **Exact email match** against `emails:` array → definite match.
2. **Exact Slack handle match** against `slack:` array → definite match.
3. **Exact full name match** against `title:` or `aliases:` → definite match.
4. **First-name-only match** → candidate only. Stage for review, never auto-link.
5. **Slack display name** → check against `aliases:` array; treat as candidate if not listed.
6. **Never auto-merge on partial name match alone.** If two person notes look like the same human but identifiers don't overlap, flag for manual review.

### Interaction linking contract

When an interaction note is created (via `/capture-meeting`, `/log-interaction`, or auto-logged by `/sync-people` and `/process-inbox`; note that `/log-note` does **not** trigger this contract):
- The interaction's `people:` frontmatter array lists `[[wikilinks]]` to each participant's person note.
- Each linked person note gets its `last_contact:` updated to the interaction date, and a new bullet under its `## Threads` section pointing back to the interaction note.
- Commitments extracted from the interaction land under `## Open commitments` (theirs / mine) in each linked person note.

**Auto-logged interactions.** `/sync-people` and `/process-inbox` automatically create lightweight interaction notes for direct email threads and Slack DMs/mentions involving known people (those with notes in `+ Atlas/People/`). These auto-logged notes have an auto-extracted summary and leave Decisions/Commitments/Follow-ups sections empty. Mailing lists, Google Groups, CC-only threads, bot addresses, and observer-only threads are excluded. Deduplication is by `source:` frontmatter — one interaction note per thread, and richer notes from `/capture-meeting` or `/log-interaction` always take precedence.

## 13. Chief of Staff skills

Skills live in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (vault-local, portable with the repo). Invoke as slash commands.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/daily-brief` | Daily briefing — calendar + priority mail + Slack + Asana overdue + stale relationships → refreshes the `## Morning brief` section of today's daily note. Re-runnable. |
| `/daily-review` | End-of-day (or any-time) reconciliation — check off what got done, carry forward / drop the rest, push Asana updates → refreshes the `## Evening review` section of today's daily note. Re-runnable. |
| `/process-inbox` | §4 triage across `+ Inbox/` + Gmail + Slack; auto-pushes `#asana/*` notes in scheduled mode. |
| `/meeting-prep` | Briefing for a meeting/1:1 — person note + recent interactions + open commitments + related projects + thread excerpts. |
| `/capture-meeting` | Turn raw notes into an interaction note; update linked people; propose `#asana/*` tasks. |
| `/capture-youtube` | Create a literature note from a YouTube video — fetch metadata, summarize, link to vault. |
| `/log-person` | Create an atomic person note at `+ Atlas/People/`, optionally seed context from cross-account Gmail/Slack search. |
| `/log-note` | Quick-capture a thought, observation, or log entry as an atomic note — no people or interaction required. |
| `/log-interaction` | Lightweight manual touchpoint log (no transcript needed). |
| `/log-idea` | Create an idea note at `+ Atlas/Ideas/`. |
| `/log-decision` | Record a decision with context, reasoning, and alternatives at `+ Atlas/Decisions/`. |

| `/log-organization` | Create an organization note with key people and places at `+ Atlas/Organizations/`. |
| `/log-quote` | Save a quote with attribution and source link at `+ Atlas/Quotes/`. |
| `/follow-up-draft` | Draft a reply/nudge for the right account. Saves as draft, never sends. Also invoked in batch by `/daily-brief` and `/process-inbox` for actionable "Needs a reply" items. |
| `/learn-writing-style` | Scan your sent email + Slack messages to derive a personalized writing-style profile (email vs Slack, by audience size). Updates `CLAUDE.md §6` in place. Run after initial bootstrap. |
| `/what-am-i-missing` | Surface overdue tasks, stale commitments, cadence misses, unanswered mail. |
| `/people-audit` | Cadence health report + regenerate `+ Spaces/People.md` grouping. |
| `/sync-people` | Discovery pass across Gmail/Calendar/Slack — auto-updates `last_contact` on known people, stages unknowns in `+ Inbox/people-candidates/`, proposes alias merges. |
| `/weekly-review` | Monday synthesis → `+ Atlas/Weekly Reviews/<ISO-week>.md`. |
| `/push-openbrain-claude-starter` | Genericize vault improvements, open a PR against the upstream openbrain-claude-starter repo. |
| `/pull-openbrain-claude-starter` | Pull latest template changes into the vault, interactively apply improvements. |
| `/asana` | Quick view of tasks due in the next 7 days across configured workspaces, with interactive check-off. |

Skills are markdown procedures only — they describe which MCP tools to call and which files to read/write. They do not execute code; Claude reads the SKILL.md and performs the steps.

## 14. Tool usage notes

- **Slack write operations:** The local `slack_*` MCPs support `slack_conversations_add_message` natively. Use this tool for sending messages — do not fall back to the deprecated `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__*` remote connector.
- **Before recommending any Asana task, Slack message, or Google Doc edit**, verify the target still exists (the state may have changed since the last session).

## 15. Deployment

- When deploying scripts or config files, always verify the target runtime path (e.g., `~/.config/openbrain/`) matches where you expect to run them from, not just the repo directory. The repo contains templates and tracked copies (`.openbrain/`); the live runtime copies live under `~/.config/openbrain/` (mode 755 for scripts, mode 600 for secrets).
